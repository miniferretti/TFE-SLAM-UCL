 Git repo associated to the Master Thesis "LIDAR - Camera fusion for SLAM of autonomous robot or drones" by Matteo Ferretti di Castelferretto et Bruno Nicoletta. This repo is the source of all our work and contains a ROS workspace dedicated to the exploration of different technics of integrating a 2D LiDAR to a drone. This code was developped aroud a custom mobile platform: ![alt text](https://github.com/miniferretti/TFE-SLAM-UCL/blob/main/images/mobilePlat_crop.jpg)

### Branches dispatching and explanation
---
The Git is divided into multiple branches but only two are usefully. Namely: 
- WorkStation: Branch containing the code that has to run on a desktop computer.
- Raspberry: Branch containing the code that has to run on a Raspberry Pi. 

Each of these branches has a dedicated Readme for installation procedure.
